## 2. The Task

We are in **PLANNING MODE**.

1.  **Study:** Read the Game Design Documents in `docs/gdd/` (The Specs) and the current codebase in `src/` (The Reality).
2.  **Gap Analysis:** Identify features that are specified but missing or incomplete in the code.
3.  **Plan:** Generate or Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
    *   List specific, atomic tasks (e.g., "Create `AeroBoxingController.gd`").
    *   Prioritize them logically.
    *   **DO NOT** write implementation code yet. Just the plan.

Output the content for `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

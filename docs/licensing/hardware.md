# For Hardware Partners

If you are a hardware vendor looking to integrate your device (Smart Glove, Haptic Vest, XR Headset) with AeroBeat:

1.  **You are safe.** Our Input Tier (`aerobeat-input-*`) uses **MPL 2.0**.
2.  **No Viral Infection.** You can create a repository `aerobeat-input-yourbrand` that contains a mix of Open Source GDScript and your **Closed Source SDK/DLLs**.
3.  **Linking is Allowed.** As long as you do not modify the AeroBeat Core files themselves, your proprietary logic remains yours.

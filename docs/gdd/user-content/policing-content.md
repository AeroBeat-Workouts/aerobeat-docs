# Policing Content

AeroBeat is an open platform, but it is not a lawless one. We employ a mix of **Automated AI** and **Human Moderation** to keep the ecosystem safe and legal.

## 🤖 Automated Moderation (The First Line)

Before any content appears in the "New Releases" feed, it passes through our AI filters.

*   **Text Analysis:** Titles, Descriptions, and Author Names are scanned for hate speech, slurs, and toxic language.
*   **Image Analysis:** Thumbnails and texture maps are scanned (using tools like AWS Rekognition) for NSFW content or gore.
*   **Action:** Flagged content is held in a "Pending Review" state and hidden from the public until a human moderator approves it.

## ⚖️ DMCA & Copyright

We respect intellectual property rights.

*   **The Rule:** If you upload a song or character you do not own, you must have permission.
*   **Takedown Process:** Rights holders can submit a DMCA Takedown Request via our web portal.
*   **Action:** Valid requests result in the immediate removal of the content.
*   **Strikes:** Repeat offenders will have their Creator privileges revoked.

### Streamer Mode
To protect content creators on Twitch/YouTube, the game includes a **"Streamer Mode"** toggle.
*   **Effect:** Mutes all UGC audio and replaces UGC skins with default assets, ensuring the broadcast is safe from copyright strikes.

# 🛠️ The "Skin" System (UGC)

To support the "YouTube" vision, visual content is strictly separated from game logic.

* **Logic (The Skeleton):** A "Target" is just a mathematical hitbox and a timestamp.
* **Skin (The Visuals):** Artists can replace the default `targets`, `obstacles`, `portals`, and `hands` to skin the games visuals.
* **Environment:** The included environments can be replaced easily. Transporting athletes anywhere from a *Live Concert Stage* to the *Moon*.

This allows the community to create "Total Conversion" aesthetics without touching a line of code. 

Simply select a playlist and the engine takes care of the rest.

# 🌐 Community Creations

When athletes navigate our community content portal, they can search and filter through various `playlists`. These are collections of content remixed to work together for a good workout experience by the community.

Every `playlist` is made up of multiple pieces of community content and is specific to a Gameplay style and difficulty level. (ex: A `Boxing` playlist is not the same as a `Flow` playlist, and a `easy` playlist is not the same as a `pro` playlist)

* **Songs:** - Musicians can add their songs to the platform for others to use.
* **Choreography:** - Custom choreography written for songs using our in-game charting software. The choreographer uploads their work under a specific difficulty level (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `pro`). Limited to one chart per difficulty per song.
* **Environments:** - Environments change up the background visuals and looping sound effects during a song. One environment is paired with one song in the playlist.
* **Art Assets:** - Artists can create custom visuals for the `targets`, `obstacles`, `portals`, and `hands` used per song in the playlist. 
* **Coaching:** - Trainers can upload motivational content to guide athletes through a workout.
    *   **Warm Up:** A video playing before the first song.
    *   **Audio Overlays:** Voice-over tracks that play on top of specific songs (e.g., "Punch harder!").
    *   **Cool Down:** A video playing after the last song.
    
When creating a `playlist`, a creator uses our in-game community content browser to pick the following.

* **Gameplay:** - What gameplay style is this playlist made for? (`Boxing`, `Flow`, etc)
* **Difficulty:** - Choose what difficulty level this playlist is intended for (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `pro`).
* **Songs:** - What songs are in this playlist? Limited to songs with existing choreography that matches your playlist and difficulty.
* **Choreography:** - Optional: By default we use the most popular choreography chart per gameplay and difficulty, however you can override this to choose another match.
* **Environments:** - Optional: Change the recommended environment. Once selection per song in the playlist.
* **Assets:** - Optional: Change the recommended visuals such as `targets`, `obstacles`, `portals`, and `hands`.
* **Coaching:** - Optional: Select a **Coaching Pack** to apply warm-up/cool-down videos and per-song audio overlays.

When choosing any playlist (official or community created), athletes can override the following.

* **Environment:** - Disable custom environments from being used, instead using your preferred settings in your profile.
* **Assets:** - Disable custom assets from being used, instead using your preferred settings in your profile.
* **Coaching:** - Disable all coaching material from playing.

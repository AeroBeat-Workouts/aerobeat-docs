# ⭐ Community Edition

AeroBeat will be available from our website as the "Community Edition" for PC/Mac/Linux/Android, with the following features.

* **Free-To-Win** - Download for free from our website. Uses a `supporter` model to fund development.
* **Headset Free VR** - Brings the popular rhythm workout gameplay seen in VR titles to 2D screens using a standard Webcam.
* **Gameplay Modes** - Multiple rhythm gameplay modes. `Boxing`, `Flow`, `Dance`, and `Step` available across devices.
* **View Modes** - Change `view` styles between `track` and `portal` to visualize the gameplay in different ways, with each option being best for different purposes (`track` has targets rising from bottom-to-top in a 2D track like dance-dance-revolution and is best for small screens and mobile, while `portal` is a first person immersive view, great for TV's and VR).
* **Multiplayer** - Supports both local and online multiplayer modes with `supporters` and `friends`.
* **Play Anywhere** - Downloaded playlists are available offline and region free.
* **Runs On Your Device** - Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android phones. Unavailable on iOS due to restrictions.

* **Playlist Of The Day** - Featured pre-screened playlist our `supporters` want to shout-out as the `playlist of the day` for everyone to see.
* **Meet Your Fitness Goals** - Track your progress and achieve your weekly workout goals to build good workout habits.

To fund development, we will use a `supporter` model. Pay a one time fee for each month you wish to support AeroBeat and recieve the following account perks. These are similar to the perks given in the touch rhythm platform `Osu!` to their supporters, but with some new additions.

* **Discord:** : Access `supporter` only sections of our Discord channel and visual flairs to your account
* **Account Icon** : Shows your status as a supporter each time you log in
* **Avatar Options** : Access supporter only customizations to be purchased with your `workout points`
* **Leaderboard Shoutouts** : Supporters have their own tab on playlist leaderboards and their name on a leaderboard list is called out as being a supporter.
* **Increased Friends List** : Double the size of your friends list (500 to 1000)
* **Early Builds:** : Gain access to in-development feature builds
* **Supporter-Only Polls:** : Supporters can voice their opinion on polls only available to them.

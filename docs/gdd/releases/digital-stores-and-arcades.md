# 📱 Digital Stores & Arcade Editions

Porting AeroBeat to digital storefronts and Arcades requires the following changes from the community edition to be successful.

* **Top-40 Music:** - Publisher funding would be used to pay for the rights to popular music
* **Choreography:** - Each song would be choreographed for our various difficulty levels as needed.
* **Collaborations:** - Custom environments and assets would be created in collaborations with IP holders.
* **Community Features:** - Generally unaccessible in these ports to prevent bad experiences with casual athletes.

Each version of AeroBeat across storefronts would have a unique selling point.

* **Arcade:** - Quick jump-in and play of individual songs. Use a touch screen to choose your gameplay style, song, and start! Uses the `portal` view with high resolution environments. Allows two players if there's enough physical space.
* **Mobile:** - Focuses on fitness goals with a stripped down version of our Community edition's user interface. Defaults to `track` view for small screens.
* **Steam:** - Similar to the mobile release, but defaults to `portal` view and high-resolution environments.

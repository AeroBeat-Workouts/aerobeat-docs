# 🌊 Gameplay Core: "Flow"

The "Flow" module focuses on large, continuous movements using virtual bats. It is designed to improve range of motion, core stability, and balance.

### The Loop
1.  **The Beat:** Targets fly toward the athlete from a central portal.
2.  **The Action:** The athlete must swing their bats (Left=Black, Right=White) through the targets in the direction indicated.
3.  **The Feedback:** Successful hits create a satisfying slice effect and maintain the combo.
4.  **The Workout:** Focuses on core rotation, shoulder mobility, and lower body stability.

### Mechanics
*   **Bats:** The athlete wields two bats. Left is Black, Right is White.
*   **360 Target Ring:** Targets spawn along a 360-degree ring with two distinct zones:
    *   **Outer Ring:** Requires full arm extension and body movement.
    *   **Inner Ring:** Requires half-movements. Used for rapid "drumming" or "rope swing" rhythms.
*   **Directional Swings:** Targets have arrows indicating the required cut direction.
*   **Trails (Arcs):** Visual lines that guide the athlete's arm movement from one position to another, sometimes without targets, creating "Zen-like" flow or setting up the next hit.
*   **No Guard:** There are no blocking targets in Flow mode.

### Obstacles & Fitness Prefabs
Obstacles in Flow work similarly to Boxing but include specialized fitness movements:
*   **Walls/Bars:** Force squats and leans.
*   **Leg Lifts:** Triangular obstacles requiring the athlete to lift one leg horizontally while balancing.
*   **Run In Place:** Rapid sequences of obstacles requiring a running motion.
*   **Coaching Callouts:** For complex fitness moves (Leg Lifts, Run In Place), coaches are encouraged to verbally prepare the athlete for the weight shift, especially at lower difficulties.

### Portals
*   **Active Portal:** Targets and obstacles spawn from the currently active portal.
*   **Rotation:** Just like in Boxing, portals can appear 360 degrees around the player. The choreography (swings) should guide the player's rotation to face the new portal.

### View Modes
*   **Portal View:** Targets emerge from the active portal in 3D space.
*   **Track View:** The 360 ring is mapped to linear lanes.
    *   *Top/Bottom Targets:* Mapped to height.
    *   *Side Targets:* Mapped to left/right lanes.

# 🕹️ Difficulty Modifiers

These gameplay modifiers make the game easier or harder.

* **One Portal:** Forces choreography while in `portal` view to appear from a single forward facing `portal` in `boxing` and `flow` playlists.
* **3-Portals:** Condenses choreography while in `portal` view to appear in three portals (left, center, right) ahead of you in `boxing` and `flow` playlists.
* **Ghost Targets:** `targets` disappear as they get close to you in `boxing`, `flow`, and `step` gameplay.
* **Speed Up:** `targets` and `obstacles` take less time to travel from `portals` and the bottom of the `track`. Available on `boxing`, `flow`, and `step` gameplay styles.
* **Slow Down:**: `targets` and `obstacles` take more time to travel from `portals` and the bottom of the `track`. Available on `boxing`, `flow`, and `step` gameplay styles.
* **Arcade Mode:** Adds a health system that depletes as you miss `targets`. Miss too many and you fail the song. Regain health as you destroy `targets` and dodge `obstacles`.
* **Hardcore Mode:** Miss a `target`, or hit a `bomb` or `obstacle` to get sent back to the beginning of a song in a playlist.

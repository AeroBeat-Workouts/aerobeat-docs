New portals open up requiring VR players to face them by rotating their body and head. Controller players use L1/R1, DPAD, or Control Sticks to snap to portal positions. Camera players are automatically rotated to face them. If too many portals appear too quickly, the 2D players see targets and obstacles appear from the same portal to avoid snap-fatique and visual problems reading the choreography.</li> <li>3-Portal-View: Only left, center, and right Portals appear in front of you, keeping you forward facing but adding more strategy to your workouts. For Camera users, all portals are visible at all times without moving your head and targets and obstacles fly towards you, without the need for you to 'rotate', because you can't as a Camera player.</li> <li>Simultaneous-Portals: Targets and obstacles can appear from multiple simultaneous portals. Used typically on Pro level difficulty. In VR you have to move to quickly face these new portals to hit targets with high accuracy and dodge obstacles while switching positions rapidly (left, center, right). In 2D the targets and obstacles appear from portals on the left and the right side of the center portal, but fly towards the player in the center without requiring the user adjust their body or head rotation.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/future-plans/","title":"\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Gameplay Agnosticism","text":"<p>In time, additional gameplay modules will become available, based on community requests and support.</p>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/future-plans/#boxing","title":"BOXING:","text":"<p>Our initial gameplay style we are creating.</p> <ul> <li>Gameplay: Punch targets to destroy them and dodge obstacles.</li> <li>Based On: SuperNatural VR's <code>Boxing</code> gameplay.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/future-plans/#flow","title":"FLOW:","text":"<ul> <li>Gameplay: Swing bats at targets to destroy them and dodge obstacles.</li> <li>Based On: SuperNatural VR's <code>Flow</code> gameplay, and first popularized in Beat Saber.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/future-plans/#step","title":"STEP:","text":"<ul> <li>Gameplay: Step on targets as they come towards you.</li> <li>Based On: Made popular with Dance Dance Revolution in arcades</li> </ul>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/future-plans/#dance","title":"DANCE:","text":"<ul> <li>Gameplay: Perform popular dance moves to match the gestures.</li> <li>Based On: Originally popularized with the Dance Central series.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"gdd/gamification/overview/","title":"\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Workout Points &amp; Goals","text":"<p>The following gamification systems will be included in the full release to help build healthy workout habits.</p> <ul> <li>Workout Points: - Playlists award <code>workout points</code> after completing them, you can see your total workout points since you started playing AeroBeat on the main menu near your account icon.</li> <li>Weekly Goal: - Set how many times you want to workout per week, and AeroBeat will automatically track this.

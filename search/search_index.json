Can be hit by either <code>hand</code>.</li> <li>Obstacles: Orange lines that force the athlete to Squat (Legs) or Lean (Core), or both. Counts as hitting a target if you dodge these with your <code>head</code>, otherwise it counts as a <code>miss</code>. Note: Only the head is tracked for collision. Athletes should be reminded not to over-extend their body, as moving just the head is sufficient to clear the obstacle.</li> <li>Stance Changes: Stance indicators appear on the track to guide the athlete's foot placement. While the game does not track feet in Boxing mode, proper stance is critical for power and flow.<ul> <li>Orthodox: Swap body position so your Left Foot is pointing forward.</li> <li>Southpaw: Swap body position so your Right Foot is pointing forward.</li> <li>Note: Failing to change your body to the correct side does not affect your score. It is merely a guide to keep the athlete in proper form for the upcoming choreography.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Knee Strikes: Lift your left or right knee at the right time to hit the black or white knee strike target. Always appears physically low in the portal.<ul> <li>Tracking: Detected by checking the horizontal alignment of the player's Head relative to the target lane, inferring a weight shift. This allows players to substitute the move for a Block or Crunch if unable to perform high-impact leg lifts.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Leg Lifts: Lift your left or right leg horizontally at the right time to match the shape of the obstacles flying at you. Counts as if a <code>obstacle</code> hit you if your <code>head</code> touches the side of the <code>obstacle</code> shape. (ex: a triangle that extends far to the left, signifying a left leg lift).</li> <li>Run In Place: Rings of obstacles fly at the athlete rapidly. Signifies an an optional run-in-place segment for the athlete.</li> <li>360-Portal-View: Portals can appear within a full 360 ring around you. New portals open up requiring VR players to face them by rotating their body and head. Controller players use L1/R1, DPAD, or Control Sticks to snap to portal positions. Camera players are automatically rotated to face them. If too many portals appear too quickly, the 2D players see targets and obstacles appear from the same portal to avoid snap-fatique and visual problems reading the choreography.<ul> <li>Active Portal: The portal currently spawning targets is highlighted. In Pro modes, side portals may also become active simultaneously, requiring rapid focus shifts.</li> <li>Portal Trails: A visual particle stream flows from the bottom of every active portal towards the player. This helps the athlete center themselves relative to the portal and catches the eye when a new portal opens.</li> <li>The Anchor: The athlete's position is fixed at the center. Gameplay relies on rotation (swivel), not locomotion.</li> </ul> </li> <li>3-Portal-View: Only left, center, and right Portals appear in front of you, keeping you forward facing but adding more strategy to your workouts. For Camera users, all portals are visible at all times without moving your head and targets and obstacles fly towards you, without the need for you to 'rotate', because you can't as a Camera player.</li> <li>Simultaneous-Portals: Targets and obstacles can appear from multiple simultaneous portals. Used typically on Pro level difficulty. In VR you have to move to quickly face these new portals to hit targets with high accuracy and dodge obstacles while switching positions rapidly (left, center, right). In 2D the targets and obstacles appear from portals on the left and the right side of the center portal, but fly towards the player in the center without requiring the user adjust their body or head rotation. Note: This mechanic is discouraged for standard fitness flows as it breaks the rotation rhythm.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/dance/","title":"\ud83d\udc83 Gameplay Core: \"Dance\"","text":"<p>The \"Dance\" module brings the full-body choreography experience to AeroBeat.</p>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/dance/#the-loop","title":"The Loop","text":"<ol> <li>The Beat: A virtual coach performs dance moves on screen in sync with the music.</li> <li>The Action: The athlete mimics the movements of the coach as if looking in a mirror.</li> <li>The Feedback: Motion matching algorithms score your pose accuracy and timing.</li> <li>The Workout: Full-body cardio, coordination, and flexibility.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"gdd/gameplay/dance/#mechanics","title":"Mechanics","text":"<ul> <li>The Coach: A 3D avatar that demonstrates the current move.</li> <li>Pictograms: Scrolling icons on the side of the screen preview the next move (e.g., \"Spin\", \"Clap\", \"Slide\").</li> <li>Pose Matching: The core scoring mechanic.

Emphasize them, but remind athletes that if they cannot perform the impact, they can swap the action for a Guard/Block or Crunch.<ul> <li>Why this works: In Boxing mode, the game tracks the Head Position relative to the target lane rather than the physical leg. As long as the athlete shifts their weight (head) to the correct position where they would be if they lifted their knee, the hit will register.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Obstacles (Walls/Bars): Remind athletes that the game only tracks their Head for collisions. They do not need to contort their entire body to avoid a wall, just their head. This prevents over-extension and injury.</li> <li>Flow - Leg Lifts &amp; Run In Place: These are high-intensity fitness intervals. Remind athletes that the specific leg movement is not scored. If they cannot perform the action safely, they should modify it (e.g., a small lift or a stretch) rather than risking injury.

This is highly recommended for immersion. 1.  Record your video against a green background. 2.  In the Coaching SDK, select your video resource. 3.  Enable \"Transparent Background\" in the inspector. The engine uses a real-time shader to remove the green, making you appear inside the game environment!</p> <p>Q: Can I remix an existing playlist? A: Yes. You can load an existing playlist in the SDK, add your coaching tracks, and save it as a Remix.
